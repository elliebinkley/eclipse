2. For using time_fmt with systemClock under chrono namespace.
   There are two versions of the input/output chrono functions since Boost 1.52.0. 
   which affects the compilation of time_fmt().
   Since Boost 1.55.0, the newer version is used by default. 
   If you use a version older than 1.55.0, you must define the macro BOOST_CHRONO_VERSION 
   and set it to 2 
   chrono v1 includes;  does not work on cygwin... 
   #include <boost/chrono/io_v1/chrono_io.hpp>  
   v2 includes; works on cygwin., But need to set 
   #define BOOST_CHRONO_VERSION 2 in file chrono/config.hpp.
